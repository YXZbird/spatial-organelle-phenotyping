# Data directory

This directory contains input image data and derived metadata used in the
image-based spatial phenotyping pipeline.

The data structure is organized to clearly separate raw images from
derived, analysis-ready tables.

## images/

**Description**
- Contains multichannel microscopy image tiles used as input to the analysis.
- Images are stored as TIFF files with channels ordered consistently across tiles.

**Subfolders**
- `treated/`  
  Image tiles acquired under the treated experimental condition.
- `untreated/`  
  Image tiles acquired under the untreated control condition.

**Notes**
- Experimental condition labels are encoded at the folder (tile) level only.
- These labels are **not** used during feature extraction and are excluded
  from machine learning feature matrices to prevent information leakage.
- Image tiles are treated as independent acquisition units for
  cross-validation and evaluation purposes.

## metadata/

**Description**
- Contains tabular data derived from image analysis.
- Files in this directory are generated by the analysis notebooks
  and are not manually edited.

**Key files**
- `02_manifest__*.csv`  
  Tile-level manifest listing image paths and experimental group labels.

- `toy_cell_spatial_features__*.csv`  
  Cell-level feature table generated in Notebook 02, including:
  - spatial features for each cell
  - cell class (mono- vs multi-nuclear)
  - tile identifier and experimental group label

**Notes**
- Metadata files are designed to be analysis-ready inputs for downstream
  statistical or machine learning workflows.
- No raw image data are modified during metadata generation.

## Scope and limitations

- The dataset provided here is a small-scale example intended for
  method development and pipeline demonstration.
- Machine learning analyses performed on these data are exploratory
  and not intended to establish predictive performance.
- Results should be interpreted in the context of limited sample size
  and tile-level experimental design.

---

## Reproducibility

- All files in this directory are generated or consumed by notebooks
  in the `notebooks/` directory.
- The pipeline is deterministic given fixed random seeds and identical
  input images.
